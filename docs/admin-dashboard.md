# Introduction

Welcome to the user manual and setup guide for the Metro platform!

This document aims to answer any questions you (The User) might have about the functions and capabilities of Metro. Congratulations on choosing Metro to facilitate your IPO underwriting operations! ðŸ¥³

# Architecture

The Metro platform is made up of three components,  which together make up the Metro ecosystem. These components are:

- The Metro Client Dashboard
- The Metro Admin Dashboard
- The Metro Core Integration

The relationship between these can be seen in the data flow diagram below:

# Metro Installation Guide

## Installation

- Manual Installation
- Docker Installation
- Ubuntu (Docker)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Docker)

## Overview

The Metro platform can be provisioned in a number of ways. This guide covers how to install Metro across several different platforms.  However, we recommend the Docker approach, using containers and orchestration.



## Manual Installation

### Requirements



```
PHP >= 8.0.0
BCMath PHP Extension
Ctype PHP Extension
JSON PHP Extension
Mbstring PHP Extension
OpenSSL PHP Extension
PDO PHP Extension
Tokenizer PHP Extension
XML PHP Extension
MySQL PHP Extension

```



### Step 1 : Clone Metro from the Source

Normally, an instance would have been provisioned by Orba when installing the Metro platform in your environment.  However, in the very rare and very extraordinary case where you need to clone the source, it can be done with the following steps.

In most instances, Metro would be installed under the `/var/www/` folder, for most Linux distributions.

```
$ mkdir -p /var/www/metro
$ cd /var/www/metro 
$ git clone https://github.com/metro-ipo/admin-dashboard

```

### 

### Step 2: Point the domain to the uploaded folder

Depending on your web server, you will need to point your domain or subdomain to the `public` directory inside the Metro folder.  In this case, the full path would be;

`/var/www/metro/admin-dashboard/public`.



**Please Note: Metro MUST be installed on a primary domain or subdomain. Installing on a sub-folder will NOT work. For example:**

```
`example.com/metro` (Invalid)
`localhost/metro` (Invalid)
`example.com` (Valid)
`metro.example.com` (Valid)
`metro.test` (Valid)

```

### 

### Step 4: Fix File Permissions

Ensure that your web server has the correct permissions. In your `metro` root folder.  Run the command: `chmod -R 775 ./`



**Step 5: Installing Dependencies**

Fundamentally, Metro is powered by Laravel.  Due to this, the **environment**, **dependencies**, **migrations**, and **seeders** have to be run.   While in the `metro`folder perform the following.

```
$ composer install
$ cp .env.example .env
$ php artisan storage:link || true
$ php artisan key:generate
$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder --force

```

Once these commands have been run successfully, your base Metro instance is now configured and seeded.



### Step 6: Complete installation

Open the link to the domain in your browser (For Example: https://demo.metroipo.com) and log into Metro by using  the following **default**  email and password.

```
email: admin@admin
password: password

```

That&#39;s it!

Now, let&#39;s look at the Docker Installation process!

# Docker Installation

Before attempting the Docker installation it is **_recommended_** that you have adequate docker and container experience.

**Please   Note:** Metro is composed of several containers as described in it&#39;s `docker-compose.yml` file.



### Step 1: Install Docker

Install Docker on your host: [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)



### Step 2: Install Docker Compose

Install docker-compose by using this guide: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**NOTE:**

If `docker-compose â€”version` fails with:

```
docker-compose: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object: Operation not permitted

```

run this command: `sudo mount /tmp -o remount,exec`



### Step 3: Clone Metro from the Source

Normally, an instance would have been provided by Orba when installing the Metro platform in your environment.  However, in rare cases where you would need to clone the source, it can be done with the following steps:

```
$ mkdir -p /var/www/metro
$ cd /var/www/metro 
$ git clone https://github.com/metro-ipo/admin-dashboard

```

**NOTE:** In most instances, Metro would be installed under the `/var/www/` folder, for most Linux distributions.



### Step 4: Performing the Setup

Change your current working directory and run your app using the commands below:

```bash
$ cd metro-admin
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up -d
$ chmod +x ./docker-compose/setup.sh
$ docker-compose exec app composer config --global --auth github-oauth.github.com `INSERT_GITHUB_ACCESS TOKEN`
$ docker-compose exec app composer i --ignore-platform-reqs
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan jwt:secret
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan config:clear

```



### Step 5: Complete installation

Open your web browser and go to your given domain (default: http://localhost)

On Installation - Database setup, use the following credentials  :

```
Database Host: `db`
Database Name: `metro`
Database Username: `metro`
Database Password: `metro`

```

That&#39;s it!

Now, let&#39;s look at how to execute  the Ubuntu Installation below.



## Ubuntu (Docker)

### Prerequisites;

1.   Access to an **Ubuntu 18.04** local machine or development server as a non-root user with sudo privileges. **NOTE:** If youâ€™re using a remote server, we strongly suggest having an active firewall installed. To set these up, please refer to this guide [Initial Server Setup Guide for Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04) on Digital Ocean.
1. Ensure Docker is installed on your server, following Steps 1 and 2 of [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04).
1. Docker Compose must be installed on your server. You can refer to this Guide: [How To Install Docker Compose on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04).

### 

# The Ubuntu (Docker) Installation Process

### Step 1: Clone Metro from the Source

Normally, an instance would have been provided by Orba when installing the Metro platform in your environment. however, in  extraordinary cases where you need to clone the source, it can be done with the following steps.

```
$ mkdir /var/www/metro
$ cd /var/www/metro 
$ git clone https://github.com/metro-ipo/admin-dashboard

```

**NOTE:** In most instances, Metro would be installed under the `/var/www/`  folder, for most Linux distributions.



### Step 2: Verify Permissions

Please verify that your **current user&#39;s** UID matches with the **given UID** on the `docker-compose.yml` file in the application&#39;s root folder:

```yaml
    build:
      args:
        user: metro-user
        uid: 1000

```

If it doesn&#39;t match, Update the compose.yml file before going ahead with step 3.

> Hint: You can get the UID by running `id` command in the terminal.
> **(_NOTE:_** _If  this is not done correctly, then you may get an error on step 4_).

### 



### Step 3: Setup Docker Containers

Change your current working directory and start containers using the given commands below:

```bash
$ cd /var/www/metro/admin-dashboard
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up -d

```

Before running the setup script, double-check your `.env` file and ensure that the correct credentials are loaded.  If you want to opt for the MySQL instance running on Docker, ensure that the credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` are the following:

```
Database Host: `db`
Database Name: `metro`
Database Username: `metro`
Database Password: `metro`

```



### Step 4: Install Composer Dependencies &amp; Generate App Key

After the containers are built and started, we can now run the commands below to _install_  **composer dependencies** &amp; _generate_ a **unique**  **application key.**

```
$ docker-compose exec app composer config --global --auth github-oauth.github.com `INSERT_GITHUB_ACCESS TOKEN`
$ docker-compose exec app composer i --ignore-platform-reqs
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan jwt:secret
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan config:clear

```



### Step 5: Complete installation

Open your web browser. Then go to your given domain and access the default user account with the following email and password.

```
email: admin@admin
password: password

```

That&#39;s it !

Now let&#39;s go through the steps to Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( Docker).



## Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Docker)

### Prerequisites:

1. Access to **RHEL 7/8** local machine or development server as a non-root user with sudo privileges. If youâ€™re using a remote server, we strongly suggest having an active firewall installed.
1. Ensure that Docker is installed on your server.   Please refer to the official guide at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/).

Fill out this form with the Broker and Currency of your choice (these would have been added prior to creating the Offer) and upload an image of the banking details information. Finish by clicking &quot;Add Banking Details&quot;.



### Add Instructions For your Customers

Add instructions that you would like your customers to follow when applying to the offers on your site here.  Click the button &quot;Add Instructions&quot; to do so. It&#39;s highlighted for you below.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/nkaGpP9fn-8amdb3KgyPjcJA.png)

After clicking this button, a text box will pop up.  Add a short name (an abbreviated name) for your offer in the relevant field and  type the instructions that you want your clients to follow. Click the blue &quot;Add instructions&quot; button at the bottom of the window to complete this step.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/Ir-54WeA5dKwpD-1OmHvAO5h.png)



### Add a Share Pool

Share Pools are critical and **MUST correspond to a JSE Batch number,** otherwise, a Share Pool can become invalid. So how can you add a share pool?

**Step 1**

Click on the &quot;Pools&quot; tab, then click on &quot;Add Share Pool&quot;. This has been highlighted below.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/pZ7JhArojebrlWFib1lkDfiA.png)

**Step 2**. Fill out the form that appears once you&#39;ve clicked the &quot;Add Share Pool&quot; button. Fill out the form with the stock information provided by the JSE, which includes the Description for the Share Pool, its Minimum/Maximum Shares, the Increment Size, and the Unit Price.  Next, select the banking details and the currency. (You will be able to select the Banking Details and Currency from the mini drop-down menus at these fields because you entered this info in the previous steps.) Now click the &quot;Add Share Pool&quot; button at the bottom of this window to save the changes you&#39;ve just made.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/ChIZxChqFVqLvvssDYS0LVTL.png)



### Add Desired Fees

You may then move over to the tab labeled &quot;Fees&quot;. Click the button that says &quot;Add Fee&quot;. It has been highlighted in the image below.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/YZ7brUfxMpMxC3lcmO7W7Tk6.png)

You will then be taken to the form  shown below,  where you can enter the Fee Name, the Fee Type (Flat or Percentage), the Amount, and the Currency.    Select the small box at the bottom of the window to indicate whether or not it is a JCSD processing fee. Complete this process by clicking &quot;Add Fee&quot;.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/_bjrXsJdAm6ye1cKV6Xbt0EL.png)



Once you click the &quot; Add Fee&quot; button, you will be redirected to page seen below.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/9eTxSM09LwxOySyPd9qHSLmd.png)



Now that you&#39;ve added all the details for the offer and created the share pool you can finally publish your offer. To do this, click the &quot;**Publish&quot;** button ( its highlighted in the image above).

And that&#39;s it!

The offer will now be made public! This means that the offer can be viewed on the Client Dashboard and your customers can now apply to it!



Now let&#39;s learn about &quot;**Applications**&quot; on the Metro Platform.

### 

### Applications

Once a Public Offer has been published and your clients have completed the application process to a particular offer,  we can  _efficiently_ create and transfer application orders to the JCSD in batches.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/XXl9pIABZ_mpnW7lA4fTbyeT.png)

## 

### Creating Batches

We can arrive  at the Batches section of Metro by simply clicking the &quot;Applications&quot; drop-down menu. Then click on the blue rectangular button labeled &quot;View Batch&quot; which is found in the top-right section side of the screen.



![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/N9ZHIFezEIMpbA4OtqBb1psH.png)

Then click the &quot;Add Batch&quot; button seen here in the image above. This will bring up the form displayed in the image below.



![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/6j3dNpImYa17RIeFW-imqxJl.png)

Fill in the fields shown in the image above and click &quot;Add Batch&quot;.

Each batch needs an ID number which must be supplied by the JSE/JCSD in order to create a batch. Without this, you cannot create a batch.



### Grouping Applications in Batches

Metro automatically groups approved applications according to the IPO that was applied to! That means that sending applications to the JCSD can be done with a few steps!

**Step 1**. Identify the batch you want to send off. See a listing of batches in the image below.

**Step 2**. Click the &quot;View&quot; button. It is circled in green for you in the image below.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/KRmBP1zD7dpq1keWiz_wEuIW.png)



**Step 3**. Click the button labeled &quot;Submit to JCSD&quot; located on the right side of the screen. And that&#39;s it! You have just sent a batch of applications off to the JCSD, in an efficient way!

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/SfBIqpFXG1rFkzi01ZULU03J.png)

## Closure Letters

Once an offer closes, it is possible to manually generate a closure letter which will be disseminated to all applicants of that offer (Note that this will only work after configuring the closure letter settings present on the general setting page; more information can be found in the general settings section of the manual).

# Settings

Now that we&#39;ve covered the main aspects of Metro, we can move on to the other functions that the Metro Platform facilitates. These include customization and general configuration.

To access the Settings menu, click on the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Just in case you are having difficulty finding it, we&#39;ve circled it for you in the image below.

NOTE: There is ONE settings menu that applies to both the private and IPO sections of Metro.

NOTE:  The JSCD Entries Section does not apply to private placements.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/PD-lvhYTh9mI_P0woicMveFc.png)



Remember, this gear opens a drop-down menu, which lists menu options.  Check out this image below to see these menu options up-close.

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/hgr7FDMX6NwuXeCpVtnaMdqx.png)



Now let&#39;s talk about what each of these options allows you to do.

## General

The first Settings menu option you will see is &quot;General&quot;. This allows you to set up reminder Email Notification settings for your Offers as well as for Closure Letters. Simply enter the email address into the empty fields that you would like notifications to be sent to or sent from.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/ENeXHU5f30pqMl901NkDB0fN.png)

### General Settings

This section now only contains an input field to toggle Mandatory Two Factor Authentication.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/5K4Yc5ZnonucvDqNOhGW4QRK.png)

When this is toggled on, both the client and the admins will have to enable Two Factor Authentication in order to use the application. If an admin or client does not have Two Factor Authentication turned on, a pop-up will show up after login prompting them to enable it.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/YdnhkiYXs9gXkLZfU4GDiuRO.png)

After clicking Enable, you will be brought to the screen displayed below.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/jqFqAx23yzfke_3YQAcQQJqx.png)

This screen displays the 2FA QR code meant to be scanned with an authenticator app on a mobile device as well as the recovery codes if the device cannot be accessed for whatever reason. You also have the option to download the codes and disable 2FA.

**Client**

Here is what 2FA would look like on the client side:

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/HETZrizG39ArcbbLwUbz6Rl6.png)

Note that the client side does not provide the option to download the recovery codes and only to copy/paste them. They are limited until more are generated using the &quot;Regenerate Recovery codes&quot; button.



**Oversubscription Validation**

By default, the system will allow administrative users to approve offer applications even after the maximum number of units has been applied for.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/i3IIzDSGi_Mb0GNDNKkyBn_7.png)

To disable this behavior and allow oversubscription validation, administrative users must navigate to the general settings page and &quot;Enable Oversubscription Validation&quot;

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/dGvbgfZM4lKJ9gHAR5O1EVsM.png)

Once the changes are saved, users will no longer be able to approve applications that will go over the subscription limit.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/y_tTh2HZHxILSOgl_gE_zxqb.png)



### Client Settings

The general settings contain information that is relevant to the client-side application. Those fields are:

- Client Logo and Banner
- Company name
- Platform Name
- Mobile App Name
- Contact Email
- Link to Android or IOS signature application
- Link to embedded map *
- A toggle for joint holder validation *
- A toggle for joint holder confirmation
- A toggle for enabling mandatory two factor authentication for both client and admin

**Please note**: For the embedded map link input field, you should put the URL found in the `src` attribute of the copied embedded map. An example of embedded map would look like this:

> &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d15176.326707049588!2d-76.7779862880707!3d18.021412726057477!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8edb3efcb798432d%3A0x29b3e98bc79c4dcc!2sSovereign%20Centre!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjm!4v1662564586581!5m2!1sen!2sjm&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; style=&quot;border:0;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer-when-downgrade&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

However, only the part highlighted in green should be placed in the embedded map link input.

**Please Note**: When the joint holder validation is enabled, the features related joint holders will become available. After the applicant reaches step 2 (joint holder step), certain information (such as names and emails) for all joint holders on the JCSD account will be automatically populated. The applicant will not be able to continue the application process unless the number of joint holders in step 2 matches the number on the JCSD account.



![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/qLPPP4mhDKt3y0j4vGjpz2HG.png)



### Closure Letter Settings

The final section of the general settings page corresponds to the closure letter. A closure letter can be generated once an offer is closed. All clients that applied to the offer will receive a closure letter once this is done.

To configure the closure letter, administrative users will need to populate the displayed field and they will appear within the generated closure letter. The fields relating to the closure letter are as follows:

**Audits**

Every action in the Metro platform is recorded and logged and can be found under &quot;**Audits**&quot;**.** The audit log shows you which user logged on, what section they conducted an activity/function in, and what activity/ function they executed. It even shows very granular data stemming down to the data changed.

## Roles and Permissions

**Definition of Terms**

Our permission system has two components Permission Types and Permission Actions. Each Permission Type has a generic list of 7 Permission Actions. You can enable and disable permission actions for each permission type when creating and editing a role. Example:

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/3AZrRX8pbUl1pVLQUaRthS_Y.png)

The permission has a large list of permission types and permission actions. Permission types include things such as Application and Share Pool. Permission types should cover most of the features within the application.

Full List of Permission Types

- Accredited Investor
- Application
- Private Application
- Private Offer
- Dashboard
- Audit
- Bank
- Broker
- Broker Selling Agent
- Currency
- Director
- Faq
- Invitee
- Jcsd Number Entries
- Prospectus
- Selling Agent
- Setting
- General Settings
- Share Pool
- Theme
- User
- Role
- Permission
- User Management
- Video
- Client
- Report
- Batch
- Submit JCSD

Each permission type is associated with 7 permission actions: View, Create, Edit, Delete, Approve, Reject and Allow.

The first six permission actions are functionally defined: View, Create, Edit, Delete, Approve, Reject and Allow. For example, for the Application permission type, the view action allows users to view applications and the create permission allows users to create applications. This pattern continues for all permission Types.

The seventh permission action, Allow, is used for all use cases not covered by the others. These are the edge cases this allows permission covers:

| Permission Type | Permission Action |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prospectus | Allow | This determines whether the user can publish an offer |
|  |  | This determines whether the user can unpublish an offer |
|  |  | This determines whether the user can download an offerâ€™s banking details. |
|  |  | This determines whether the user can generate a closure letter (this is a letter that is sent out after an offer is closed) |

## System Health

This section provides engineers with status updates that can be used to determine the root cause of any issue that may arise. This is shown below.

# Troubleshooting

This section will outline Orba&#39;s recommendations for potential, but not probable, issues that may arise after installation. To ensure that our customersâ€™ solutions/services are reliable and stable, we perform the necessary internal optimization tests to ensure our solutions meet the needs of our customersâ€™ business and maintain the confidence of our stakeholders.

##  Black Screen

When attempting to export large numbers of applications, an issue related to memory limit may arise that results in a black screen being displayed. To that end, Orba has ensured that the PHP memory size is at least 512M in order to handle large loads and uses a method that queues chunks of applications instead of attempting to handle one set of data.

**Recommendations:**

- We suggest that the client&#39;s UAT Team performs both load testing and stress testing prior to application go-live. This ensures that the testing covers the software performance under some expected load (regular or peak) and pushes the bar beyond peak conditions to determine the systemâ€™s load capacity as well as any point of a complete failure for loads that only they can project.

## Application Slowness/Lag

There  may sometimes be, depending on the client&#39;s system configurations, a slowdown in performance experienced by the client.

**Recommendations:**

-  **** Client should ensure that the **minimum** application system requirements stated in this manual are adhered to. 
- Application server&#39;s minimum specs should  be 16GB of RAM; 4 vCPUs; and 25-100GB of free disk space. If slowdown persists, then increase as needed. 
- Both UAT and Production are required to have the same specifications in terms of hardware to support Docker containers on-site.
- Additionally, migrating to a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure would adequately allow resources to scale on demand, relative to the workload. 

# Accounts with Missing Passwords in Database

There may be situations where users in the database appear not to have a password.

- This is by design; Once a primary applicant lists a Joint Holder via the application process, a User Account is automatically created and the Joint Holder is emailed, prompting the user to activate their account which involves creating and confirming their password and logging in.

# Connectivity Issues

If Depend Credentials are not valid for whatever reason, then users will not be able to complete the application process.

**Recommendations:**

- Client should ensure that Depend Credentials are valid well before the IPO open date.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What other application(s) does Metro depend on?

Metro only depends on the Depend API provided by the JCSD.

## _What are the User password requirements?_ 

Password must have at least 8 characters. Passwords must contain upper and lowercase letters, a number and special character.

## _How many incorrect attempts can users make?_ 

All users receive 3 attempts to enter an incorrect password. If they get it wrong again a fourth time, then a security email will be sent to them.

## _Is there password expiration?_ 

Not currently.

## _Are previous passwords stored to prevent re-use? If so, how many hashes are stored?_ 

_No, they aren&#39;t. However, a client isn&#39;t allowed to reset their password to the one that is currently stored in the database._

## _Is there a system timeout?_  

Yes. Users are logged out after 20 minutes of inactivity by default. However, you can change the `JWT_TTL` variable in the **.env** file located in the application&#39;s root folder.  Please note that this variable accepts a number which represents the time in minutes.

## _Does Metro allow multiple sessions?_  

Concurrent sessions are not allowed. There is a prompt that allows a user to log out of sessions on other devices built into the system.

## _How do I get access to the NGINX logs?_

- SSH into the admin server
- Go to the path where the app is installed: `cd /var/www/metro/admin/dashboard/docker`
- Run `docker ps` to list the running containers

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/2QkxlQIDy42iosDGtbNYujI8.png)

- Copy the name of the container
- Now type `docker logs [nginx container name]` to see the logs. If you want to send them to a file, you can run this command: `docker logs [nginx container name] > log.txt`

## _What do I do if a user has enabled 2fa and is unable to access their 2fa codes?_

If a user is locked out of their account due to losing access to their 2fa information, simply navigate to their account page on the admin dashboard, scroll to the bottom of the page, and disable 2fa manually.

To get to the user&#39;s page, navigate to the &quot;Clients&quot; page shown on the side navigation, search for the corresponding user, and click &quot;View&quot;.
