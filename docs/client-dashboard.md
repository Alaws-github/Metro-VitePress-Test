# Applying to an Offer

Now that you have successfully logged in, it is now possible to apply for a public offer.

After selecting the desired IPO and clicking &quot;Apply now&quot; for the pool you would like to subscribe to, a modal will appear informing you of all the items you will need to have on hand in order to complete the application.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/5oyI0ShQedi2_ZY05Q3so-Jx.png)

Once you have all the items on the checklist, you can continue to the offer application.



The IPO application process is split into five (5) main sections: Primary Details, Joint Holders, Payment &amp; Refunds, Signature &amp; verification, and Review.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/PTlnrxf1jO1mtMeIgPG8Ej_3.png)

The P**rimary Detail** section will ask you for all the basic information that the company needs for your application to be completed. This includes your name, TRN, JCSD Number, Telephone Number, Address, Nationality, Occupation, and the number of units you intend to apply for.

If you are applying as a Corporation, you will need to add all relevant directors at this step of the application



The **Joint Holder** section allows you to input all joint holders on a JCSD account into the application. If automatic joint holder validation is enabled by your vendor, the application form will automatically be populated with all the correct joint holders.

PLEASE NOTE: The person completing the application form is considered the &quot;Primary Holder&quot;. Do NOT put another holder&#39;s name and TRN number on the Primary Detail page, nor should you try to enter your name/TRN on the joint holder step.



The **Payment &amp; Refund** section is where you will input your payment details with relevant proof of payment, as well as account details for your refund and dividend mandate.



The **Signature &amp; Verification** step is where you will sign to confirm that you and all relevant joint holders agree to the terms of the application as well as the number of units being applied for. There are two ways you can sign for the application. Either by downloading the application form or by using the eSignature mobile app (if available).

If the form is downloaded, you and all joint applicants will be required to physically sign the document, scan it, and reupload the form.

If the eSignature method is used, follow the instructions on the screen to generate a code. Use that code in the mobile app and draw your signature.

The **Review** step shows you all the information you have entered so you can verify its correctness. If you see any changes to be made, you can click the edit button for that section and quickly navigate to that step.



After verifying that all the information is valid, submit your application, and it will be processed accordingly.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/XtxMKpyguSab2VeohOJsRLHK.png)

**N.B.:** If joint holders were added to the application, they will receive an email after the application is submitted prompting them to create an account on the Metro platform so that they can confirm their signature.



# Applications Page

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/pGb73bxX60tYd5Mk9O7Odcxv.png)

This page shows all applications that are associated with your account.

## My Applications

This tab will display all public applications that you are the primary applicant for. That is, if you started the application with your account, the application will show up under this tab. Here, a list of applications is shown on the left and can either be marked with the Draft, Pending, Rejected, or Approved tags.

You can click on any of the applications in the list to see the details for that application.

Applications can only be deleted in the draft stage.



## Joint Applications

Any application that you are added to as a joint holder will appear here once the application is submitted. You can view the applications in this tab and confirm your willingness to participate in the IPO. If the eSignature method was used by the primary applicant to complete the application, you will be required to download the eSignature app and affix your signature.



## Director Applications

Any application that you are added to as a director will appear here once the application is submitted. You can view the applications in this tab and confirm your willingness to participate in the IPO. If the eSignature method was used by the primary applicant to complete the application, you will be required to download the eSignature app and affix your signature.



# Profile Page

This page is useful for editing basic information, applying for accreditation status, and managing your password.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/-b6xMWpgVDTNmFPwlpBJgng9.png)



## Profile Info

On the Profile Info tab, you are able to view/update basic information such as your name, TRN, Telephone Number, Address, Nationality, Occupation, and the number of units you intend to apply for.



## Accreditation

This tab allows you to apply for accreditation so that you may apply to Private Offers (discussed later) as an accredited investor. On this tab, you will complete a checklist, as well as outline your assets and liabilities. Afterward, you upload your identification and supporting documents and then apply for accreditation.

If your application to become an accredited investor is rejected, don&#39;t worry! You can always update your information and apply again at a later date.



## Password

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/ubrwyFAS7-ie4Y9F9iNYQqbN.png)

This tab allows you to change your password as well as enable two-factor authentication.

(2-factor authentication requires you to have a mobile authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Authy and can be disabled at any time).



# Private Offers

Private offers are an exclusive, invite-only set of offers that your vendors may choose to invite you to at any point. If your vendor wishes for you to apply to one of their private offers, an email will be sent to you with an invite link. This link requires you to have a valid account associated with your email address to proceed.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/MFde3iGrnyoE5yniMvG9IywZ.png)

Once you accept this invite, you will be redirected to the private offer section of the client dashboard. If you want to access the private offer section normally, simply click the dropdown on the offers page and select &quot;Private Offers&quot; to see all the private offers you have accepted an invite for.

## Applying for a Private Offer

Applying for a private offer is very similar to the public offer application process. Once you click &quot;Apply&quot;, you will be taken to an overview screen.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/6PrCpi21_dvbxnSGMmk47XPB.png)

Unlike public offers, however, private offers do not have share pools, so simply click &quot;Apply Now&quot; and a modal will appear with a link to the information memorandum. Once you have read the memorandum, you should Agree to the terms and begin the application process.



As opposed to the public offer application process, the private application process has four (4) steps - Primary Details, Joint Holders, Payment &amp; Refunds, and Review &amp; Sign.



## Applying as an Accredited Investor

On the Primary Details page, there is an &quot;Applying as&quot; dropdown. If you have completed the accreditation application and have been approved as an accredited investor, you will be able to select &quot;Accredited Investor&quot; from the dropdown. If not, a modal will pop up encouraging you to apply to be an accredited investor.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/bCrwBYVtBFU0ItD6HV_rEOXB.png)



## Joint Holders/Directors

Similarly to the public application, you can add all relevant joint holders to the application on this page. However, if you apply as a Corporation, you will add them at this step instead of the Primary Details section.



## Payment &amp; Refund

The Payment &amp; Refund **** section is where you will input your payment details with relevant proof of payment, as well as account details for your refund and dividend mandate.



## Review &amp; Sign

At this step, you download the provided application form, fill out the relevant fields, then re-upload. There may also be an attached Mandate form and Confirmation form - if those are present, you will be required to download and sign them before proceeding with the application.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/c7wTc_L6UkMzk_6y5P-4scaT.png)

Once completed, continue with the application and a modal will appear.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/BDeiu-Klm15QJieaeU7BfkG0.png)

After reading and accepting the terms, check the checkbox and proceed to submit your application.

![](https://slabstatic.com/prod/uploads/55j7qjmx/posts/images/0ZV--NF1GysVot6aHJpmTH7j.png)

Once your application is submitted successfully, you may go to the application page and review your applications.

(Note: Private applications can be found on the Applications page by clicking the dropdown and switching to Private Offers.)
